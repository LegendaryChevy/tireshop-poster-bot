Here is a list of interesting facts about VR technology and history. Keep these in mind, but you are not limited to only these facts.

* Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) was created in 1994 to create interactive 3D graphics on the World Wide Web, although it never became widely used due to the technological limitations of the time.
* Google introduced a low-cost VR platform called Google Cardboard in 2014, which uses a fold-out cardboard viewer in conjunction with a smartphone, making VR more accessible to the public.
* The Oculus Rift, one of the first consumer-targeted virtual reality headsets, was funded through a Kickstarter campaign in 2012, raising over $2.4 million. Facebook later acquired Oculus VR for approximately $2 billion in 2014.
* Augmented reality (AR) gained mainstream attention with the release of Pok√©mon Go in 2016, where players could capture virtual creatures overlaid onto the real world on their smartphones.
* Surgical training is one of the significant applications of VR, allowing doctors to practice complicated surgeries in a consequence-free environment.
* The first truly "AR phone," the Tango-enabled Lenovo Phab2 Pro, was released in 2016, with sensors and software designed to map physical spaces for augmented reality apps. However, Google has since deprecated the Tango platform in favor of ARCore.
* In 1995, Nintendo released one of the first portable console-based VR headsets known as the Virtual Boy. However, it was a commercial failure due to its high price, limited color graphics (monochromatic), and lack of software support.
* Virtual reality requires at least a framerate of 60 frames per second (fps) to create a comfortable user experience and reduce the risk of motion sickness. However, modern VR aims for 90 fps or higher for the smoothest possible experience.
* Haptic feedback technology in VR is advancing to the point where users can feel sensations, such as a light breeze or the recoil of a gun, enhancing the immersion of virtual environments.
* HTC Vive, released in 2016, introduced room-scale VR, allowing users to walk around a physical space translated into virtual movement, enhancing the immersive experience.
* One of the challenges in creating convincing VR experiences is overcoming the uncanny valley, a term used to describe the discomfort people feel when computer-generated figures look almost, but not quite, like real humans.
* Modern VR headsets use a technology called six degrees of freedom (6DoF), which tracks both your head's orientation and movement in space, allowing for more realistic and immersive movement within a virtual environment.
* The first documented use of the term "Augmented Reality" was by Boeing researcher Tom Caudell in the early 1990s, describing the process of overlaying digital data onto the physical world.
* Magic Leap is a company known for its secretive development of mixed reality products. It released its first product, Magic Leap One, in 2018, which uses Digital Lightfield technology to project digital objects into the user's field of view seamlessly.
* The concept of telepresence - feeling as if you're actually in a different place while using virtual reality - is being enhanced by integrating real-time 3D capture technology, allowing for live virtual meetings and interactions.
* In 2021, Facebook (now Meta) announced its commitment to developing the metaverse, a collective virtual shared space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical and digital reality. This points towards a future where VR and AR technologies could become part of everyday online social and professional interactions.
* The first consumer virtual reality headset with integrated motion tracking was the Razer OSVR (Open Source Virtual Reality), launched in 2016, which aimed to standardize the development of VR gaming.
* Eye-tracking technology is starting to be integrated into newer VR headsets, allowing for more natural interaction and an increase in rendering efficiency by focusing processing power on where the user is looking (a technique called foveated rendering).
* In 2014, Google introduced 3D scanning as part of its Project Tango, aiming to map the world in 3D to enhance augmented reality experiences, though it was eventually shelved in favor of ARCore, as mentioned before.
* The concept of "social VR" is growing, with platforms like VRChat allowing users to interact with others in a virtual space, embodying custom avatars and participating in a wide range of activities.
* In professional sports training, VR is used to enhance athletes' cognitive abilities by simulating real-game scenarios and decision-making under pressure without the physical strain of being on the field.
* Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is being used as a method for treating PTSD, anxiety, and phobias by exposing patients to their fears in a controlled virtual environment.
* In 2019, Valve released the Index VR headset, with a refresh rate of 120 Hz (up to 144 Hz in experimental mode) and "off-ear" audio designed to enhance the sense of presence in VR.
* A concept called "pass-through AR" is being used in VR headsets where cameras on the device capture the outside world and display it within the headset, allowing virtual elements to be overlaid on the user's actual environment.
* "Ready Player One," a novel by Ernest Cline adapted into a film by Steven Spielberg in 2018, features an expansive virtual reality universe called the OASIS. The story has significantly influenced public perception of VR, depicting a future where VR is intertwined with daily life and serves as an escape from the real world.
* The concept of BCI (Brain-Computer Interfaces) is advancing, hinting towards a future where VR experiences could be controlled by thought. Startups like Neurable are developing technology to interpret brain activity for interaction within virtual environments.
* In the field of architecture, VR is revolutionizing the way architects visualize and present their designs. Clients can now "walk" through buildings before they are constructed, providing a better sense of space and design than traditional 2D renderings.
* The global VR market size was valued at approximately $10.32 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, with projections suggesting the industry could be worth as much as $57 billion by 2027.
* Advanced VR simulation is being used in the automotive industry for vehicle prototyping and design. Companies like Ford and BMW use VR to visualize car models in full scale, reducing the time and cost of developing physical prototypes.
* "Ready Player One" also impressed upon the VR industry the importance of haptic suits and full-body tracking, which are now being developed and refined for more immersive experiences. Products like the Teslasuit integrate full-body haptic feedback to simulate sensations such as touch and temperature.
* The concept of virtual tourism is on the rise, with VR allowing users to visit and explore destinations around the world from the comfort of their home. Even Google Earth VR lets one stand atop mountains or walk the streets of famous cities.
* Educational uses of VR are expanding, with institutions incorporating VR into their curriculum to enhance learning. From history classes where students can visit ancient civilizations, to medical students practicing surgeries, VR's potential in education is vast.
* In the military, VR is being utilized for training purposes, from combat scenarios to medical training, providing realistic and cost-effective simulations that can be run repeatedly without the same risk or expense as live training exercises.
* "Ready Player One" reinforced the concept of digital economies within virtual worlds. Today, actual VR platforms have integrated virtual economies where users can create, buy, and sell goods in a digital marketplace, using virtual or real-world currencies.
* Photogrammetry, the process of using photographs to create 3D models, is being used to create hyper-realistic environments in VR, allowing for the creation of virtual spaces indistinguishable from their real-world counterparts.
* Film festivals and events are creating VR categories and showcasing 360-degree films, recognizing VR as an emerging art form that provides novel storytelling opportunities and a different level of audience engagement.
